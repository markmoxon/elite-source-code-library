.nmiBitplane8

 SKIP 1                 \ Used when sending patterns to the PPU to calculate the
                        \ address offset of bitplanes 0 and 1
                        \
                        \ Gets set to nmiBitplane * 8 to given an offset of 0
                        \ for bitplane 0 and an offset of 8 for bitplane 1
