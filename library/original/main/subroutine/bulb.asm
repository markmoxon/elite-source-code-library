\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The y-coordinate of the bulb as a low-byte screen
\                       address offset within screen page &7D (as both bulbs
\                       are on this character row in the dashboard)
\
\   (Y X)               The address of the character definition of the bulb to
\                       be drawn (i.e. ECBT for the E.C.M. bulb, or SPBT for the
\                       space station bulb)
