\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Arithmetic)
\    Summary: Calculate (S A) = (S R) + (A Q)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following between sign-magnitude numbers:
\
\   (S A) = (S R) + (A Q)
\
\ where the sign bytes only contain the sign bits, not magnitudes.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the addition overflowed, clear otherwise
