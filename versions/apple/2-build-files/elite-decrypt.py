# APPLE II ELITE DECRYPTION SCRIPT
#
# Written by Mark Moxon
#
# This script removes encryption and checksums from the compiled binaries for
# the Apple II version of Elite
#
# Files are saved using the decrypt.bin suffix so they don't overwrite any
# existing unprot.bin files, so they can be compared if required
#
# Run this script by changing directory to the repository's root folder and
# running the script with "python 2-build-files/elite-decrypt.py"
#
# You can decrypt specific releases by adding the following arguments, as in
# "python 2-build-files/elite-decrypt.py -rel2" for example:
#
#   -rel1   Decrypt the game disc on Ian Bell's site
#   -rel2   Decrypt the version built by the source disc
#   -rel3   Decrypt the binaries already on the source disc
#
# If unspecified, the default is rel1
