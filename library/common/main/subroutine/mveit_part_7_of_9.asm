\    Summary: Move current ship: Rotate ship's orientation vectors by pitch/roll
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine has multiple stages. This stage does the following:
\
\   * Rotate the ship's orientation vectors according to our pitch and roll
\
\ As with the previous step, this is all about moving the other ships rather
\ than us (even though we are the one doing the moving). So we rotate the
\ current ship's orientation vectors (which defines its orientation in space),
\ by the angles we are "moving" the rest of the sky through (alpha and beta, our
\ roll and pitch), so the ship appears to us to be stationary while we rotate.
