\    Summary: A four-colour mode 1 pixel byte that represents a dot's distance
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The following table contains colour bytes for 2-pixel mode 1 pixels, with the
\ index into the table representing distance. Closer pixels are at the top, so
\ the closest pixels are cyan/red, then yellow, then red, then red/yellow, then
\ yellow.
\
\ That said, this table is only used with odd distance values, as set in the
\ parasite's PIXEL3 routine, so in practice the four distances are yellow, red,
\ red/yellow, yellow.
