# Compiled game disks for the Commodore 64 version of Elite

This folder contains the d64 disk images for the Commodore 64 version of Elite, as produced by the build process. There is one d64 file for each supported release. These d64 images can be loaded into an emulator like VICE, or into a real Commodore 64.

Right on, Commanders!
