\       Name: NWSHP
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Universe
\    Summary: Add a new ship to our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
\ block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
\ empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there
\ isn't enough free memory for the new ship, it isn't added.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
\                       list of ship types)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the ship was successfully added, clear if it
\                       wasn't (as there wasn't enough free memory)
\
\   INF                 Points to the new ship's data block in K%

 STA T                  \ Store the ship type in location T

 LDX #0                 \ Before we can add a new ship, we need to check
                        \ whether we have an empty slot we can put it in. To do
                        \ this, we need to loop through all the slots to look
                        \ for an empty one, so set a counter in X that starts
                        \ from the first slot at 0. When ships are killed, then
                        \ the slots are shuffled down by the KILLSHP routine, so
                        \ the first empty slot will always come after the last
                        \ filled slot. This allows us to tack the new ship's
                        \ data block and ship line heap onto the end of the
                        \ existing ship data and heap, as shown in the memory

 CPX #NOSH              \ If we haven't reached the last slot yet, loop back up
 BCC NWL1               \ to NWL1 to check the next slot (note that this means
                        \ only slots from 0 to #NOSH - 1 are populated by this
                        \ routine, but there is one more slot reserved in FRIN,
                        \ which is used to identify the end of the slot list
                        \ when shuffling the slots down in the KILLSHP routine)
