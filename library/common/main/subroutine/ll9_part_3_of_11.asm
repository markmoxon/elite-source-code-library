\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing ships
\    Summary: Draw ship: Set up orientation vector, ship coordinate variables
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part sets up the following variable blocks:
\
\   * XX16 contains the orientation vectors, divided to normalise them
\
\   * XX18 contains the ship's x, y and z coordinates in space

 LDX #5                 \ First we copy the three orientation vectors into XX16,
                        \ so set up a counter in X for the 6 bytes in each
                        \ vector

.LL15

 LDA XX1+21,X           \ Copy the X-th byte of sidev to the X-th byte of XX16
 STA XX16,X

 LDA XX1+15,X           \ Copy the X-th byte of roofv to XX16+6 to the X-th byte
 STA XX16+6,X           \ of XX16+6

 LDA XX1+9,X            \ Copy the X-th byte of nosev to XX16+12 to the X-th
 STA XX16+12,X          \ byte of XX16+12

 DEX                    \ Decrement the counter

 BPL LL15               \ Loop back to copy the next byte of each vector, until
                        \ we have the following:
                        \
                        \   * XX16(1 0) = sidev_x
                        \   * XX16(3 2) = sidev_y
                        \   * XX16(5 4) = sidev_z
                        \

                        \   * XX16(11 10) = roofv_z
                        \

                        \   * XX16(17 16) = nosev_z

 LDA #197               \ Set Q = 197
 STA Q

 LDY #16                \ Set Y to be a counter that counts down by 2 each time,
                        \ starting with 16, then 14, 12 and so on. We use this
                        \ to work through each of the coordinates in each of the
                        \ orientation vectors

.LL21

 LDA XX16,Y             \ Set A = the low byte of the vector coordinate, e.g.
                        \ nosev_z_lo when Y = 16

 ASL A                  \ Shift bit 7 into the C flag

 LDA XX16+1,Y           \ Set A = the high byte of the vector coordinate, e.g.
                        \ nosev_z_hi when Y = 16

 ROL A                  \ Rotate A left, incorporating the C flag, so A now
                        \ contains the original high byte, doubled, and without
                        \ a sign bit, e.g. A = |nosev_z_hi| * 2

 JSR LL28               \ Call LL28 to calculate:
                        \
                        \   R = 256 * A / Q
                        \
                        \ so, for nosev, this would be:
                        \
                        \   R = 256 * |nosev_z_hi| * 2 / 197
                        \     = 2.6 * |nosev_z_hi|

 LDX R                  \ Store R in the low byte's location, so we can keep the
 STX XX16,Y             \ old, unscaled high byte intact for the sign

 BPL LL21               \ Loop back for the next vector coordinate until we have
                        \ divided them all

                        \ By this point, the vectors have been turned into
                        \ scaled magnitudes, so we have the following:
                        \
                        \   * XX16   = scaled |sidev_x|
                        \   * XX16+2 = scaled |sidev_y|
                        \   * XX16+4 = scaled |sidev_z|
                        \
                        \   * XX16+6  = scaled |roofv_x|
                        \   * XX16+8  = scaled |roofv_y|
                        \   * XX16+10 = scaled |roofv_z|
                        \
                        \   * XX16+12 = scaled |nosev_x|
                        \   * XX16+14 = scaled |nosev_y|
                        \   * XX16+16 = scaled |nosev_z|

 LDX #8                 \ Next we copy the ship's coordinates into XX18, so set
                        \ up a counter in X for 9 bytes

.ll91

 LDA XX1,X              \ Copy the X-th byte from XX1 to XX18
 STA XX18,X

 DEX                    \ Decrement the loop counter

 BPL ll91               \ Loop back for the next byte until we have copied all
                        \ three coordinates

                        \ So we now have the following:
                        \
                        \   * XX18(2 1 0) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
                        \
                        \   * XX18(5 4 3) = (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
                        \
                        \   * XX18(8 7 6) = (z_sign z_hi z_lo)

 LDA #255               \ Set the 15th byte of XX2 to 255, so that face 15 is
 STA XX2+15             \ always visible. No ship definitions actually have this
                        \ number of faces in the cassette version, but this
                        \ allows us to force a vertex to always be visible by
                        \ associating it with face 15 (see the blueprints for
                        \ the Cobra Mk III at SHIP5 and asteroid at SHIP10 for
                        \ examples)

 LDY #12                \ Set Y = 12 to point to the ship blueprint byte #12,

 LDA XX1+31             \ If bit 5 of the ship's byte #31 is clear, then the
 AND #%00100000         \ ship is not currently exploding, so jump down to EE29
 BEQ EE29               \ to skip the following

                        \ Otherwise we fall through to set up the visibility
                        \ block for an exploding ship
