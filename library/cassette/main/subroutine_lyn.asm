\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: Clear most of a row of pixels
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set pixels 0-233 to the value in A, starting at the pixel pointed to by SC.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The value to store in pixels 1-233 (the only value that
\                       is actually used is A = 0, which clears those pixels)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Y                   Y is set to 0
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   SC5                 Contains an RTS
