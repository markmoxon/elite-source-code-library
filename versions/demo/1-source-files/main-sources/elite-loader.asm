\       Name: Elite loader (Part 1 of 6)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Loader
\    Summary: Include binaries for recursive tokens, Python blueprint and images
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The loader bundles a number of binary files in with the loader code, and moves
\ them to their correct memory locations in part 3 below.
\
\ There are two files containing code:
\
\   * WORDS9.bin contains the recursive token table, which is moved to &0400
\     before the main game is loaded
\
\   * PYTHON.bin contains the Python ship blueprint, which gets moved to &7F00
\     before the main game is loaded
\
\ and four files containing images, which are all moved into screen memory by
\ the loader:
\
\   * P.A-SOFT.bin contains the "ACORNSOFT" title across the top of the loading
\     screen, which gets moved to screen address &6100, on the second character
\     row of the monochrome mode 4 screen
\
\   * P.ELITE.bin contains the "ELITE" title across the top of the loading
\     screen, which gets moved to screen address &6300, on the fourth character
\     row of the monochrome mode 4 screen
\
\   * P.(C)ASFT.bin contains the "(C) Acornsoft 1984" title across the bottom
\     of the loading screen, which gets moved to screen address &7600, the
\     penultimate character row of the monochrome mode 4 screen, just above the
\     dashboard
\
\   * P.DIALS.bin contains the dashboard, which gets moved to screen address
\     &7800, which is the starting point of the four-colour mode 5 portion at
\     the bottom of the split screen
\
\ The routine ends with a jump to the start of the loader code at ENTRY.

\   Category: Drawing the screen
\    Summary: VDU commands for setting the square mode 4 screen
\  Deep dive: The split-screen mode in BBC Micro Elite
\             Drawing monochrome pixels on the BBC Micro
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This block contains the bytes that get written by OSWRCH to set up the screen
\ mode (this is equivalent to using the VDU statement in BASIC).
\
\ It defines the whole screen using a square, monochrome mode 4 configuration;
\ the mode 5 part for the dashboard is implemented in the IRQ1 routine.
\
\ The top part of Elite's screen mode is based on mode 4 but with the following
\ differences:
\
\   * 32 columns, 31 rows (256 x 248 pixels) rather than 40, 32
\
\   * The horizontal sync position is at character 45 rather than 49, which
\     pushes the screen to the right (which centres it as it's not as wide as
\     the normal screen modes)
\
\   * Screen memory goes from &6000 to &7EFF, which leaves another whole page
\     for code (i.e. 256 bytes) after the end of the screen. This is where the
\     Python ship blueprint slots in
\
\   * The text window is 1 row high and 13 columns wide, and is at (2, 16)
\
\   * The cursor is disabled
\
\ This almost-square mode 4 variant makes life a lot easier when drawing to the
\ screen, as there are 256 pixels on each row (or, to put it in screen memory
\ terms, there's one page of memory per row of pixels).
\
\ There is also an interrupt-driven routine that switches the bytes-per-pixel
\ setting from that of mode 4 to that of mode 5, when the raster reaches the
\ split between the space view and the dashboard.

                        \ above the end of screen memory

 STY David3-2           \ Y was set to 0 above, so this modifies the OS01
                        \ routine above by changing the TXS instruction to BRK,
                        \ so calls to OS01 will now do this:
                        \
                        \   LDX #&FF
                        \   BRK

                        \ don't call OS01 again

                        \ We now enter a loop that starts with the counter in Y
                        \ (initially set to 0). It calls JSR &01F1 on the stack,
                        \ which pushes the Y-th byte of BLOCK on the stack
                        \ before encrypting the Y-th byte of BLOCK in-place. It
                        \ then jumps back to David5 below, where we increment Y
                        \ until it reaches a value of ENDBLOCK - BLOCK. So this
                        \ loop basically decrypts the code from TUT onwards, and
                        \ at the same time it pushes the code between BLOCK and
                        \ ENDBLOCK onto the stack, so it's there ready to be run

                        \ we've also managed to set BPUTV to &01F1, and as BPUTV
                        \ is the vector that OSBPUT goes through, these three
                        \ bytes are actually doing JSR &01F1
                        \

                        \ return with an RTS, but instead it removes the return
                        \ address from the stack and jumps to David5 below after
                        \ pushing the Y-th byte of BLOCK onto the stack and
                        \ EOR'ing the Y-th byte of TUT with the Y-th byte of

                        \ This obfuscation probably kept the crackers busy for a

                        \ EOR above changes the first of these to &00, so this
                        \ jump goes to a BRK instruction, which in turn goes to

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is copied to the stack at &01F1. It pushes BLOCK to ENDBLOCK onto
\ the stack, and decrypts the code from TUT onwards.
\
\ The 15 instructions for this routine are pushed onto the stack and executed
\ there. The instructions are pushed onto the stack in reverse (as the stack
\ grows downwards in memory), so first the JMP gets pushed, then the STA, and
\ so on.
\
\ This is the code that is pushed onto the stack. It gets run by a JMP call to
\ David2, which then calls the routine on the stack with JSR &01F1.
\
\    01F1 : PLA             \ Remove the return address from the stack that was
\    01F2 : PLA             \ put here by the JSR that called this routine
\

\

\    01FA : STA TUT,Y
\
\    01FD : JMP (David9)    \ Jump to the address in David9
\
\ The routine is called inside a loop with Y as the counter. It counts from 0 to
\ ENDBLOCK - BLOCK, so the routine eventually pushes every byte between BLOCK
\ and ENDBLOCK onto the stack, as well as EOR'ing each byte from TUT onwards to
\ decrypt that section.
\
\ The elite-checksums.py script reverses the order of the bytes between BLOCK
\ and ENDBLOCK in the final file, so pushing them onto the stack (which is a
\ descending stack) realigns them in memory as assembled below. Not only that,
\ but the last two bytes pushed on the stack are the ones that are at the start
\ of the block at BLOCK, and these contain the address of ENTRY2. This is why
\ the RTS at the end of part 4 above actually jumps to ENTRY2 in part 5.

\       Name: TT26
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Text
\    Summary: Print a character at the text cursor (WRCHV points here)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine prints a character at the text cursor (XC, YC). It is very
\ similar to the routine of the same name in the main game code, so refer to
\ that routine for a more detailed description.
\
\ This routine, however, only works within a small 14x14 character text window,
\ which we use for the tape loading messages, so there is extra code for fitting
\ the text into the window (and it also reverses the effect of line feeds and
\ carriage returns).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The character to be printed
\
\   XC                  Contains the text column to print at (the x-coordinate)
\
\   YC                  Contains the line number to print on (the y-coordinate)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   A is preserved
\
\   X                   X is preserved
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\    Summary: The loader's screen-mode interrupt handler (IRQ1V points here)
\  Deep dive: The split-screen mode in BBC Micro Elite
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The main interrupt handler, which implements Elite's split-screen mode.
\
\ This routine is similar to the main IRQ1 routine in the main game code, except
\ it's a bit simpler (it doesn't need to support the mode-flashing effect of
\ hyperspace, for example).
\
\ It also sets Timer 1 to a different value, 14386 instead of 14622. The split
\ in the split-screen mode does overlap more in the loader than in the game, so
\ it's interesting that they didn't fine-tune this version as much.
\
\ For more details on how the following works, see the IRQ1 routine in the main
\ game code.
