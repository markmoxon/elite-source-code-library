\       Name: LL9 (Part 7 of 12)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing ships
\    Summary: Draw ship: Calculate the visibility of each of the ship's vertices
\  Deep dive: Drawing ships
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section continues the coordinate adding from part 6 by finishing off the
\ calculation that we started above:
\
\                      [ sidev_x roofv_x nosev_x ]   [ x ]   [ x ]
\   vector to vertex = [ sidev_y roofv_y nosev_y ] . [ y ] + [ y ]
\                      [ sidev_z roofv_z nosev_z ]   [ z ]   [ z ]
\
\ The gets stored as follows, in sign-magnitude values with the magnitudes
\ fitting into the low bytes:
\
\   XX15(2 0)           [ x y z ] . [ sidev_x roofv_x nosev_x ] + [ x y z ]
\
\   XX15(5 3)           [ x y z ] . [ sidev_y roofv_y nosev_y ] + [ x y z ]
\
\   (U T)               [ x y z ] . [ sidev_z roofv_z nosev_z ] + [ x y z ]
\
\ Finally, because this vector is from our ship to the vertex, and we are at the
\ origin, this vector is the same as the coordinates of the vertex. In other
\ words, we have just worked out:
\
\   XX15(2 0)           x-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   XX15(5 3)           y-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   (U T)               z-coordinate of the current vertex
