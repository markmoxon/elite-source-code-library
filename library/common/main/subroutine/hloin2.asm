\       Name: HLOIN2
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Remove a line from the sun line heap and draw it on-screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Specifically, this does the following:
\
\   * Set X1 and X2 to the x-coordinates of the ends of the horizontal line with
\     centre YY(1 0) and length A to the left and right
\
\   * Set the Y-th byte of the LSO block to 0 (i.e. remove this line from the
\     sun line heap)
\
\   * Draw a horizontal line from (X1, Y) to (X2, Y)
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   YY(1 0)             The x-coordinate of the centre point of the line
\
\   A                   The half-width of the line, i.e. the contents of the
\                       Y-th byte of the sun line heap
\
\   Y                   The number of the entry in the sun line heap (which is
\                       also the y-coordinate of the line)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved
