\ ELITE-A DISC IMAGE SCRIPT
\
\ Elite-A is an extended version of BBC Micro Elite by Angus Duggan
\
\ The original Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright
\ Acornsoft 1984, and the extra code in Elite-A is copyright Angus Duggan
\
\ The code on this site is identical to Angus Duggan's source discs (it's just
\ been reformatted, and the label names have been changed to be consistent with
\ the sources for the original BBC Micro disc version on which it is based)
\
\ The commentary is copyright Mark Moxon, and any misunderstandings or mistakes
\ in the documentation are entirely my fault
