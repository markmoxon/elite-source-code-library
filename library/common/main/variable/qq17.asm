 SKIP 1                 \ Contains a number of flags that affect how text tokens
                        \ are printed, particularly capitalisation:
                        \
                        \   * If all bits are set (255) then text printing is
                        \     disabled
                        \
                        \   * Bit 7: 0 = ALL CAPS
                        \            1 = Sentence Case, bit 6 determines the
                        \                case of the next letter to print
                        \
                        \   * Bit 6: 0 = print the next letter in upper case
                        \            1 = print the next letter in lower case
                        \
                        \   * Bits 0-5: If any of bits 0-5 are set, print in
                        \               lower case
                        \
                        \ So:
                        \
                        \   * QQ17 = 0 means case is set to ALL CAPS
                        \
                        \   * QQ17 = %10000000 means Sentence Case, currently
                        \            printing upper case
                        \
                        \   * QQ17 = %11000000 means Sentence Case, currently
                        \            printing lower case
                        \
                        \   * QQ17 = %11111111 means printing is disabled
