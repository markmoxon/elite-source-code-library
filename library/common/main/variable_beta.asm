.BETA

 SKIP 1                 \ The current pitch angle beta, which is reduced from
                        \ JSTY to a sign-magnitude value between -8 and +8
                        \
                        \ This describes how fast we are pitching our ship, and
                        \ determines how fast the universe pitches around us
                        \
                        \ The sign bit is also stored in BET2, while the
                        \ opposite sign is stored in BET2+1
