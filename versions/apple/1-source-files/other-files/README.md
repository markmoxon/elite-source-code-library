# Other files for the Apple II version of Elite

This folder contains other binaries from the original game disk for the Apple II version of Elite on Ian Bell's personal website.

* [hello#0x0801.BAS](hello#0x0801.BAS) is the BASIC loader for the game

Currently diskm8 does not seem to work with the hello BASIC program, so this folder also includes pre-rolled disk images for each variant that contain the correct version of the hello program.

Right on, Commanders!
