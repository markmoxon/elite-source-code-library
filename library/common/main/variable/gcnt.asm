                        \ When this is displayed in-game, 1 is added to the
                        \ number, so we start in galaxy 1 in-game, but it's
                        \ stored as galaxy 0 internally

                        \ The galaxy number increases by one every time a
                        \ galactic hyperdrive is used, and wraps back round to
                        \ the start after eight galaxies
