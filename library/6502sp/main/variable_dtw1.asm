\    Summary: A mask for applying the lower case part of Sentence Case to
\             extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00100000 = apply lower case to the second letter of a word onwards
\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence
\ case}, which calls routine MT2 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.
