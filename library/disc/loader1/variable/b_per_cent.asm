 EQUB 22, 7             \ Switch to screen mode 7

 EQUB 23, 0, 10, 32     \ Set 6845 register R10 = %00100000 = 32
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \ This is the "cursor start" register, and bits 5 and 6
                        \ define the "cursor display mode", as follows:
                        \
                        \   * %00 = steady, non-blinking cursor
                        \
                        \   * %01 = do not display a cursor
                        \
                        \   * %10 = fast blinking cursor (blink at 1/16 of the
                        \           field rate)
                        \
                        \   * %11 = slow blinking cursor (blink at 1/32 of the
                        \           field rate)
                        \
                        \ We can therefore turn off the cursor completely by
                        \ setting cursor display mode %01, with bit 6 of R10
                        \ clear and bit 5 of R10 set
