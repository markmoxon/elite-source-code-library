\   Category: Drawing ships
\    Summary: Draw ship: Add all visible edges to the ship line heap
\  Deep dive: Drawing ships
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part adds all the visible edges to the ship line heap, so we can draw
\ them in part 12.
