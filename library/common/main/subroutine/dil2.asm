\
\       Name: DIL2
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Dashboard
\    Summary: Update the roll or pitch indicator on the dashboard
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The indicator can show a vertical bar in 16 positions, with a value of 8
\ showing the bar in the middle of the indicator.
\
\ In practice this routine is only ever called with A in the range 1 to 15, so
\ the vertical bar never appears in the leftmost position (though it does appear
\ in the rightmost).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The offset of the vertical bar to show in the indicator,
\                       from 0 at the far left, to 8 in the middle, and 15 at
\                       the far right
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              The C flag is set

 LDY #1                 \ We want to start drawing the vertical indicator bar on
                        \ the second line in the indicator's character block, so
                        \ set Y to point to that row's offset

 STA Q                  \ Store the offset of the vertical bar to draw in Q

                        \ We are now going to work our way along the indicator
                        \ on the dashboard, from left to right, working our way
                        \ along one character block at a time. Y will be used as
                        \ a pixel row counter to work our way through the
                        \ character blocks, so each time we draw a character
                        \ block, we will increment Y by 8 to move on to the next
                        \ block (as each character block contains 8 rows)
