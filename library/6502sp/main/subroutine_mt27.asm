 LDA #217               \ Set A = 217, so when we fall through into MT28, the
                        \ 217 gets added to the current galaxy number, so the
                        \ extended token that is printed is 217-219 (as this is
                        \ only called in galaxies 0 through 2)

 EQUB &2C               \ Skip the next instruction by turning it into
                        \ &2C &A9 &06, or BIT &06A9, which does nothing apart
                        \ from affect the flags
