\       Name: PIXEL
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Draw a 1-pixel dot, 2-pixel dash or 4-pixel square
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw a point at screen coordinate (X, A) with the point size determined by the
\ distance in ZZ. This applies to the top part of the screen (the monochrome
\ mode 4 portion).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The screen x-coordinate of the point to draw
\
\   A                   The screen y-coordinate of the point to draw
\
\   ZZ                  The distance of the point (further away = smaller point)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   PX4                 Contains an RTS
