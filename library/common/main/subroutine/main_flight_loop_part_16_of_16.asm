\       Name: Main flight loop (Part 16 of 16)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Main loop
\    Summary: Process laser pulsing, E.C.M. energy drain, call stardust routine
\  Deep dive: Program flow of the main game loop
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Process laser pulsing
\
\   * Process E.C.M. energy drain
\
\   * Jump to the stardust routine if we are in a space view
\
\   * Return from the main flight loop

 LDA LAS2               \ If the current view has no laser, jump to MA16 to skip
 BEQ MA16               \ the following

 LDA LASCT              \ If LASCT >= 8, jump to MA16 to skip the following, so
 CMP #8                 \ for a pulse laser with a LASCT between 8 and 10, the
 BCS MA16               \ the laser stays on, but for a LASCT of 7 or less it
                        \ gets turned off and stays off until LASCT reaches zero
                        \ and the next pulse can start (if the fire button is
                        \ still being pressed)
                        \
                        \ For pulse lasers, LASCT gets set to 10 in ma1 above,
                        \ and it decrements every vertical sync (50 times a
                        \ second), so this means it pulses five times a second,
                        \ with the laser being on for the first 3/10 of each
                        \ pulse and off for the rest of the pulse
                        \
                        \ If this is a beam laser, LASCT is 0 so we always keep
                        \ going here. This means the laser doesn't pulse, but it
                        \ does get drawn and removed every cycle, in a slightly
                        \ different place each time, so the beams still flicker
                        \ around the screen

 JSR LASLI2             \ Redraw the existing laser lines, which has the effect
                        \ of removing them from the screen

 LDA #0                 \ Set LAS2 to 0 so if this is a pulse laser, it will
 STA LAS2               \ skip over the above until the next pulse (this has no
                        \ effect if this is a beam laser)

 BEQ MA70               \ If we have no energy left, jump to MA70 to turn our
                        \ E.C.M. off

.MA69

 LDA ECMA               \ If an E.C.M is going off (our's or an opponent's) then
 BEQ MA66               \ keep going, otherwise skip to MA66

 DEC ECMA               \ Decrement the E.C.M. countdown timer, and if it has
 BNE MA66               \ reached zero, keep going, otherwise skip to MA66

.MA70

 JSR ECMOF              \ If we get here then either we have either run out of
                        \ energy, or the E.C.M. timer has run down, so switch
                        \ off the E.C.M.
