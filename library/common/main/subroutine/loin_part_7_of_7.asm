\
\       Name: LOIN (Part 7 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and right or down and left
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and right (no swap) or down and left (swap)
\
\   * X1 >= X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right
\
IF _6502SP_VERSION OR _MASTER_VERSION \ Comment
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.
