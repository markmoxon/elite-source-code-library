\       Name: MVT3
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Moving
\    Summary: Calculate K(3 2 1) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + K(3 2 1)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add an INWK position coordinate - i.e. x, y or z - to K(3 2 1), like this:
\
\   K(3 2 1) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + K(3 2 1)
\
\ The INWK coordinate to add to K(3 2 1) is specified by X.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add to K(3 2 1), as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   Contains a copy of the high byte of the result, K+3
\
\   X                   X is preserved
