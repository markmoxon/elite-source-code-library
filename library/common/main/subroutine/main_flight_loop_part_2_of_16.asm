\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

 LDX JSTX               \ Set X to the current rate of roll in JSTX, and
 JSR cntr               \ apply keyboard damping twice (if enabled) so the roll
 JSR cntr               \ rate in X creeps towards the centre by 2

                        \ The roll rate in JSTX increases if we press ">" (and
                        \ the RL indicator on the dashboard goes to the right).
                        \ This rolls our ship to the right (clockwise), but we
                        \ actually implement this by rolling everything else
                        \ to the left (anticlockwise), so a positive roll rate
                        \ in JSTX translates to a negative roll angle alpha
