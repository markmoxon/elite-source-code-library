\    Summary: Apply pitch and roll to an orientation vector
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).
\
\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing
\ this commentary! For the rest of us, there's a detailed explanation of all
\ this in the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling".
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       transform:
\
\                         * Y = 9 rotates nosev: (nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z)
\
\                         * Y = 15 rotates roofv: (roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z)
\
\                         * Y = 21 rotates sidev: (sidev_x, sidev_y, sidev_z)
