 SKIP 1                 \ The step size for drawing circles
                        \
                        \ Circles in Elite are split up into 64 points, and the
                        \ step size determines how many points to skip with each
                        \ straight-line segment, so the smaller the step size,
                        \ the smoother the circle. The values used are:
                        \
                        \   * 2 for big planets and the circles on the charts
                        \   * 4 for medium planets and the launch tunnel
                        \   * 8 for small planets and the hyperspace tunnel
                        \
                        \ As the step size increases we move from smoother
                        \ circles at the top to more polygonal at the bottom.
