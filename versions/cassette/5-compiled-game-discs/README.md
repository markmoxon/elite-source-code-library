# Compiled game discs for the BBC Micro cassette version of Elite

This folder contains the SSD disc images for the BBC Micro cassette version of Elite, as produced by the build process. There is one SSD file for each supported release. These SSD images can be loaded into an emulator like JSBeeb or BeebEm, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

It also contains UEF tape images that will work with emulators and the TZXDuino (though you may need to unzip them before they will work with the latter).

Right on, Commanders!
