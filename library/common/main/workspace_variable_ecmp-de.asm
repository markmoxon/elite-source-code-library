                        \ pulses of a pulse laser. It is set as follows:
                        \
                        \   * 0 for a beam laser

                        \ It gets decremented every vertical sync (in the LINSCN
                        \ routine, which is called 50 times a second) and is set
                        \ to a non-zero value for pulse lasers only

                        \ The laser only fires when the value of LASCT hits
                        \ zero, so for pulse lasers with a value of 10, that
                        \ means the laser fires once every 10 vertical syncs (or
                        \ 5 times a second)
                        \
                        \ In comparison, beam lasers fire continuously as the

.GNTMP

.HFX

 SKIP 1                 \ A flag that toggles the hyperspace colour effect

                        \ up the top part of the display is temporarily switched
                        \ to mode 5 (the same screen mode as the dashboard),
                        \ which has the effect of blurring and colouring the
                        \ hyperspace rings in the top part of the screen. The
                        \ code to do this is in the LINSCN routine, which is
                        \ called as part of the screen mode routine at IRQ1.
                        \ It's in LINSCN that HFX is checked, and if it is
                        \ non-zero, the top part of the screen is not switched
                        \ to mode 4, thus leaving the top part of the screen in

                        \ "extra vessels" in part 4 of the main game loop, so
                        \ increasing the value of EV has the effect of delaying
                        \ the spawning of more vessels
                        \
                        \ In other words, this counter stops bounty hunters and
                        \ pirates from continually appearing, and ensures that
