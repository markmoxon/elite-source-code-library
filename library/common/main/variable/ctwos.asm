\    Summary: Ready-made single-pixel character row bytes for mode 5
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Ready-made bytes for plotting one-pixel points in mode 5 (the bottom part of
\ the split screen). See the dashboard routines SCAN, DIL2 and CPIX2 for
\ details.
\
\ There is one extra row to support the use of CTWOS+1,X indexing in the CPIX2
\ routine. The extra row is a repeat of the first row, and saves us from having
\ to work out whether CTWOS+1+X needs to be wrapped around when drawing a
\ two-pixel dash that crosses from one character block into another. See CPIX2
\ for more details.
