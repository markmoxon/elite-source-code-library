\    Summary: Calculate ZP = SQRT(ZP(1 0))
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following square root:
\
\   ZP = SQRT(ZP(1 0))
\
\ This routine is identical to LL5 in the main game code - it even has the same
\ label names. The only difference is that LL5 calculates Q = SQRT(R Q), but
\ apart from the variables used, the instructions are identical, so see the LL5
\ routine in the main game code for more details on the algorithm used here.
