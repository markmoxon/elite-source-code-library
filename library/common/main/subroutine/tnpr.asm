\   Category: Market
\    Summary: Work out if we have space for a specific amount of cargo
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a market item and an amount, work out whether there is room in the
\ cargo hold for this item.
\
\ For standard tonne canisters, the limit is given by the type of cargo hold we
\ have, with a standard cargo hold having a capacity of 20t and an extended
\ cargo bay being 35t.
\
\ For items measured in kg (gold, platinum), g (gem-stones) and alien items,
\ the individual limit on each of these is 200 units.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The number of units of this market item
\
\   QQ29                The type of market item (see QQ23 for a list of market
\                       item numbers)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   A is preserved
\
\   C flag              Returns the result:
\
\                         * Set if there is no room for this item
\
\                         * Clear if there is room for this item

                        \ branch with the BCC above, so the effect of this loop

                        \ and add 1

                        \ hold, as 256 Trumbles take up one ton of cargo space

                        \ so if we actually have "a" canisters and a capacity
                        \ of "c", then:
