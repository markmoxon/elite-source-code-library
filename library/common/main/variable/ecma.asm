 SKIP 1                 \ The E.C.M. countdown timer, which determines whether
                        \ an E.C.M. system is currently operating:
                        \
                        \   * 0 = E.C.M. is off
                        \
                        \   * Non-zero = E.C.M. is on and is counting down
                        \
                        \ The counter starts at 32 when an E.C.M. is activated,
                        \ either by us or by an opponent, and it decreases by 1
                        \ in each iteration of the main flight loop until it
                        \ reaches zero, at which point the E.C.M. switches off.
                        \ Only one E.C.M. can be active at any one time, so
                        \ there is only one counter
