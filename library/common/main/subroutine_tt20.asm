 JSR P%+3               \ This line calls the line below as a subroutine, which
                        \ does two twists before returning here, and then we
                        \ fall through to the line below for another two
                        \ twists, so the net effect of these two consecutive
                        \ JSR calls is four twists, not counting the ones
                        \ inside your head as you try to follow this process

 JSR P%+3               \ This line calls TT54 as a subroutine to do a twist,
                        \ and then falls through into TT54 to do another twist
                        \ before returning from the subroutine
