                        \ data here. A lot of the routines in Elite need to
                        \ access and manipulate ship data, so to make this an
                        \ efficient exercise, the ship data is first copied from
                        \ the ship data blocks at K% into INWK (or, when new
                        \ ships are spawned, from the blueprints at XX21). See
                        \ the deep dive on "Ship data blocks" for details of
                        \ what each of the bytes in the INWK data block
                        \ represents
