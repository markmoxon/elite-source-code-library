# Other files for the Apple II version of Elite

This folder contains other binaries from the original game disk for the Apple II version of Elite on Ian Bell's personal website.

* [hello#0x0801.bas](hello#0x0801.bas) is the BASIC loader for the game

I can't seem to persuade diskm8 to add the hello BASIC program to the disk image in a way that works (I just get I/O errors), so this folder includes pre-rolled disk images for each variant that already contain the correct versions of the hello program for each variant.

Right on, Commanders!
