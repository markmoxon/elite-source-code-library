\       Name: Main flight loop (Part 4 of 16)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Main loop
\    Summary: For each nearby ship: Copy the ship's data block from K% to the
\             zero-page workspace at INWK
\  Deep dive: Program flow of the main game loop
\             Ship data blocks
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Start looping through all the ships in the local bubble, and for each
\     one:
\
\     * Copy the ship's data block from K% to INWK
\
\     * Set XX0 to point to the ship's blueprint (if this is a ship)
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   MAL1                Marks the beginning of the ship analysis loop, so we
\                       can jump back here from part 12 of the main flight loop
\                       to work our way through each ship in the local bubble.
\                       We also jump back here when a ship is removed from the
\                       bubble, so we can continue processing from the next ship

                        \ Next we want to copy the ship data block from INF to
                        \ the zero-page workspace at INWK, so we can process it
                        \ more efficiently
