\    Summary: The key logger
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ In the BBC Micro versions of Elite, the key logger is separate from the lookup
\ tables that are used to convert internal key numbers into flight controls. In
\ the Commodore 64 version, the key logger is merged with the lookup table into
\ the KEYLOOK table.
\
\ The KEYLOOK table has one byte for each key in the Commodore 64 keyboard
\ matrix, and it is laid out in the same order. The keyboard matrix is exposed
\ to our code via port A on the CIA 1 interface chip, through the memory-mapped
\ locations &DC00 and &DC01. To read a key, you first set the column to scan by
\ writing to &DC00, and the details of any key that is bring pressed in that
\ column are returned in &DC01 (see the RDKEY routine for details).
\
\ The keyboard matrix layout can be seen at https://sta.c64.org/cbm64kbdlay.html
\
\ The KEYLOOK table mirrors the structure of the keyboard matrix, though it's
\ reversed so that KEYLOOK reads the keyboard matrix from the bottom corner of
\ the above diagram, working right to left and down to up.
\
\ The RDKEY routine scans the keyboard matrix and sets each entry in KEYLOOK
\ according to whether that key is being pressed. The entries that map to the
\ flight keys have labels KY1 through KY7 for the main flight controls, and
\ KY12 to KY20 for the secondary controls, so the main game code can check
\ whether a key is being pressed by simply checking for non-zero values in the
\ relevant KY entries.
\
\ The index of a key in the KEYLOOK table is referred to as the "internal key
\ number" throughout this documentation.
\
\ Note that the initial content of the KEYLOOK table is a simple repeated string
\ of "123456789ABCDEF0", as this was used in the original source code to create
\ the table during assembly. These initial values have no meaning.
