\ ELITE-A GAME DATA SOURCE
\
\ Elite-A is an extended version of BBC Micro Elite by Angus Duggan
\
\ The original Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright
\ Acornsoft 1984, and the extra code in Elite-A is copyright Angus Duggan
\
\ The code in this file is identical to Angus Duggan's source discs (it's just
\ been reformatted, and the label names have been changed to be consistent with
\ the sources for the original BBC Micro disc version on which it is based)
\
\ The commentary is copyright Mark Moxon, and any misunderstandings or mistakes
\ in the documentation are entirely my fault
\
\ The terminology and notations used in this commentary are explained at

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This source file contains the game data for Elite-A, including the game text.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This source file produces the following binary file:
\
\   * WORDS.bin
\
\ This gets loaded as part of elite-loader.asm and gets moved to &0400 during
\ the loading process.
\
\ The binary file also includes the sine and arctan tables, so the three parts
\ end up as follows:
\
\   * Recursive token table:    QQ18 = &0400 to &07FF
\   * Sine lookup table:        SNE  = &07C0 to &07DF
\   * Arctan lookup table:      ACT  = &07E0 to &07FF
