\       Name: LL118
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Move a point along a line until it is on-screen
\  Deep dive: Line-clipping
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a point (x1, y1), a gradient and a direction of slope, move the point
\ along the line until it is on-screen, so this effectively clips the (x1, y1)
\ end of a line to be on the screen.
\
\ See the deep dive on "Line-clipping" for more details.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX12+2              The line's gradient * 256 (so 1.0 = 256)
\
\   XX12+3              The direction of slope:
\
\                         * Positive (bit 7 clear) = top left to bottom right
\
\                         * Negative (bit 7 set) = top right to bottom left
\
\   T                   The type of slope:
\
\                         * 0 if it's more vertical than horizontal
\
\                         * &FF if it's more horizontal than vertical
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                x1 as an 8-bit coordinate
\
\   XX15+2              y1 as an 8-bit coordinate
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL118-1             Contains an RTS
