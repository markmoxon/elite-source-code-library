.LAS

 SKIP 1                 \ Contains the laser power of the laser fitted to the
                        \ current space view (or 0 if there is no laser fitted
                        \ to the current view)
                        \
                        \ This gets set to bits 0-6 of the laser power byte from
                        \ the commander data block, which contains the laser's
                        \ power (bit 7 doesn't denote laser power, just whether
                        \ or not the laser pulses, so that is not stored here)
