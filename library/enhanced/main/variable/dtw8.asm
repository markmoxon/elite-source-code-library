\   Category: Text
\    Summary: A mask for capitalising the next letter in an extended text token
\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is only used by one specific extended token, the {single cap}
\ jump token, which capitalises the next letter only. It has two values:
\
\   * %11011111 = capitalise the next letter
\
\   * %11111111 = do not change case
\
\ The default value is %11111111 (do not change case).
\
\ The flag is set to %11011111 (capitalise the next letter) by jump token 19,
\ {single cap}, which calls routine MT19 to change the value of DTW.
\
\ The flag is set to %11111111 (do not change case) at the start of DASC, after
\ the letter has been capitalised in DETOK2, so the effect is to capitalise one
\ letter only.
\
\ The letter to print is AND'd with DTW8 in DETOK2, which capitalises the letter
\ by clearing bit 5 (if DTW8 is %11011111). However, this AND is only done if at
\ least one of the following is true:
\
\   * Bit 7 of DTW2 is set (we are not currently printing a word)
\
\   * Bit 7 of DTW6 is set (lower case has been enabled by jump token 13, {lower
\     case}
\
\ In other words, we only capitalise the next letter if it's the first letter in
\ a word, or we are printing in lower case.
