\       Name: NORM
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Geometry)
\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in XX15
\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the
\ vector, which we can calculate using Pythagoras. Once normalised, 96 (&E0) is
\ used to represent a value of 1, and 96 with bit 7 set (&E0) is used to
\ represent -1. This enables us to represent fractional values of less than 1
\ using integers.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                The vector to normalise, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15
\
\                         * The y-coordinate in XX15+1
\
\                         * The z-coordinate in XX15+2
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector
\
\   Q                   The length of the original XX15 vector
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   NO1                 Contains an RTS

 JSR LL5                \ We now have the following:

                        \
                        \ so we can call LL5 to use Pythagoras to get:
