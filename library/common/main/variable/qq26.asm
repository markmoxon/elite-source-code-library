 SKIP 1                 \ A random value used to randomise market data
                        \
                        \ This value is set to a new random number for each
                        \ change of system, so we can add a random factor into
                        \ the calculations for market prices (for details of how
                        \ this is used, see the deep dive on "Market prices")
