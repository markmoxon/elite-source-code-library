\    Summary: The custom OSWORD routine
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ WORDV is set to point to this routine in the STARTUP routine that runs when
\ the I/O processor code first loads.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The OSWORD call to perform:
\
\                         * 240-255: Run the jump command in A (see OSWVECS)
\
\                         * All others: Call the standard OSWORD routine
\
\  (Y X)                The address of the associated OSWORD parameter block
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   SAFE                Contains an RTS

.NWOSWD

 BIT svn                \ If bit 7 of svn is set, jump to notours to process
 BMI notours            \ this call with the standard OSWORD handler

 CMP #240               \ If A < 240, this is not a special jump command call,
 BCC notours            \ so jump to notours to pass it to the standard OSWORD
                        \ handler

 STX OSSC               \ Store X in OSCC so we can retrieve it later

 STY OSSC+1             \ Store Y in OSCC+1 so we can retrieve it later

 PHA                    \ Store A on the stack so we can retrieve it later

 SBC #240               \ Set X = (A - 240) * 2
 ASL A                  \
 TAX                    \ so X can be used as an index into a jump table, where
                        \ the table entries correspond to original values of A
                        \ of 240 for entry 0, 241 for entry 1, 242 for entry 2,
                        \ and so on

 LDA OSWVECS,X          \ Fetch the OSWVECS jump table address pointed to by X,
 STA JSRV+1             \ and store it in JSRV(2 1). This modifies the address
 LDA OSWVECS+1,X        \ of the JSR instruction at JSRV below, so it will call
 STA JSRV+2             \ the subroutine from the jump table

 LDX OSSC               \ Restore the value of X we stored in OSSC, so now both
                        \ X and Y have the values from the original OSWORD call

.JSRV

 JSR &FFFC              \ This address is overwritten by the code above to point
                        \ to the relevant jump command from the OSWVECS jump
                        \ table, so this instruction runs the jump command

 PLA                    \ Retrieve A from the stack

 LDX OSSC               \ Retrieve X from OSSC

 LDY OSSC+1             \ Retrieve Y from OSSC+1

.SAFE

 RTS                    \ Return from the subroutine

.notours

 JMP &FFFC              \ This address is overwritten by the STARTUP routine to
                        \ contain the original value of WORDV, so this call acts
                        \ just like a standard JMP OSWORD call and is used to
                        \ process OSWORD calls that aren't our custom calls
