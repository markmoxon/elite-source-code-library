\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Reflect the stardust particles in the screen diagonal
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Swap the x- and y-coordinates of all the stardust particles and draw the new
\ set of particles. Called by LOOK1 when we switch views.
\
\ This is a quick way of making the stardust field in the new view feel
\ different without having to generate a whole new field. If you look carefully
\ at the stardust field when you switch views, you can just about see that the
\ new field is a reflection of the previous field in the screen diagonal, i.e.
\ in the line from bottom left to top right. This is the line where x = y when
\ the origin is in the middle of the screen, and positive x and y are right and
\ up, which is the coordinate system we use for stardust).
