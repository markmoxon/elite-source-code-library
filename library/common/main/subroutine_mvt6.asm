\       Name: MVT6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Moving
\    Summary: Calculate (A P+2 P+1) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A P+2 P+1)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following calculation, for the coordinate given by X (so this is what
\ it does for the x-coordinate):
\
\   (A P+2 P+1) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A P+2 P+1)
\
\ A is a sign bit and is not included in the calculation, but bits 0-6 of A are
\ preserved. Bit 7 is set to the sign of the result.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The sign of P(2 1) in bit 7
\
\   P(2 1)              The 16-bit value we want to add the coordinate to
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add to (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\
\                         * If X = 3, add to (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\
\                         * If X = 6, add to (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The sign of the result (in bit 7)

 TAY                    \ Store argument A into Y, for later use

 EOR INWK+2,X           \ Set A = A EOR x_sign

 BMI MV50               \ If the sign is negative, i.e. A and x_sign have
                        \ different signs, jump to MV50

                        \ The signs are the same, so we can add the two
                        \ arguments and keep the sign to get the result

 LDA P+1                \ First we add the low bytes:
 CLC                    \
 ADC INWK,X             \   P+1 = P+1 + x_lo
 STA P+1

 LDA P+2                \ And then the high bytes:
 ADC INWK+1,X           \
 STA P+2                \   P+2 = P+2 + x_hi

 TYA                    \ Restore the original A argument that we stored earlier
                        \ so that we keep the original sign

 RTS                    \ Return from the subroutine

.MV50

 LDA INWK,X             \ First we subtract the low bytes:
 SEC                    \
 SBC P+1                \   P+1 = x_lo - P+1
 STA P+1

 LDA INWK+1,X           \ And then the high bytes:
 SBC P+2                \
 STA P+2                \   P+2 = x_hi - P+2

 BCC MV51               \ If the last subtraction underflowed, then the C flag
                        \ will be clear and x_hi < P+2, so jump to MV51 to
                        \ negate the result

 TYA                    \ Restore the original A argument that we stored earlier
 EOR #%10000000         \ but flip bit 7, which flips the sign. We do this
                        \ because x_hi >= P+2 so we want the result to have the
                        \ same sign as x_hi (as it's the dominant side in this
                        \ calculation). The sign of x_hi is x_sign, and x_sign
                        \ has the opposite sign to A, so we flip the sign in A
                        \ to return the correct result

 RTS                    \ Return from the subroutine

.MV51

 LDA #1                 \ Our subtraction underflowed, so we negate the result
 SBC P+1                \ using two's complement, first with the low byte:
 STA P+1                \
                        \   P+1 = 1 - P+1

 LDA #0                 \ And then the high byte:
 SBC P+2                \
 STA P+2                \   P+2 = 0 - P+2

 TYA                    \ Restore the original A argument that we stored earlier
                        \ as this is the correct sign for the result. This is
                        \ because x_hi < P+2, so we want to return the same sign
                        \ as P+2, the dominant side
