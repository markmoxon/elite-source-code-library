# Compiled game disks for the Apple II version of Elite

This folder contains the DSK disk images for the Apple II version of Elite, as produced by the build process. There is one DSK file for each supported release. These DSK images can be loaded into an emulator like MicroM8, or into a real Apple II.

Right on, Commanders!
