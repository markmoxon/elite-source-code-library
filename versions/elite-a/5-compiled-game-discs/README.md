# Compiled game discs for Elite-A

This folder contains the SSD disc images for Elite-A, as produced by the build process. There is one SSD file for each supported release. These SSD images can be loaded into an emulator like JSBeeb or BeebEm, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

Right on, Commanders!
