\ APPLE II ELITE TRANSFER PROGRAM SOURCE
\
\ Apple II Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright
\ D. Braben and I. Bell 1986
\
\ The code in this file is identical to the source disks released on Ian Bell's
\ personal website at http://www.elitehomepage.org/ (it's just been reformatted
\ to be more readable)

\ The commentary is copyright Mark Moxon, and any misunderstandings or mistakes

\
\ This source file produces game binaries that are suitable for transfer to an
\ Apple II that's attached to a BBC Micro. The same files are also included on
\ the Firebird game disk, with the transfer code still embedded.
\
\ For file transers, the BASIC program S.APMAKES on the source disk compiles
\ this code into the ELA and ELB binaries, which it then sends it to the Apple
\ using a *APPLE command (this latter utility is not included on the disk).
\ This source replicates the functionality in S.APMAKES that produces the ELA
\ and ELB files, but it stops short of the actual transfer process.
\
\ It forms part of the PDS (Programmers' Development System) that was used when
\ developing Apple II Elite on a BBC Micro.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This transfer program can be found on the source disk on Ian Bell's site. It
\ packs the entire game binary into memory, ready to be transmitted to an Apple
\ II computer connected to the BBC Micro's User Port.
\
\ This code is run in the released variants of the game, but it doesn't have any
\ effect (apart from slowing down the load process). In the source disk variant,
\ it forms part of the development process.
\
\ As part of the build process, the assembled game is split into two parts,
\ CODE1 and CODE2 (in the original build process, the BASIC program S.SCODES
\ creates these files, while in the modern build this split is done in the
\ elite-checksum.py Python script). The split is as follows:
\
\   * CODE1 contains the first &5000 bytes, from &4000 to &8FFF.
\
\   * CODE2 contains the rest of the binary, from &9000 to &BFFF.
\
\ The source you are reading now takes these two parts and produces two more
\ binaries, ELA and ELB, which contain the two parts of the game binary, plus
\ the following routine. ELA contains CODE2, while ELB contains CODE1 and the
\ rest of the data.
\
\ For the official Firebird variant of the game, the loading process is managed
\ by a dedicated game loader. See the elite-loader.asm source for details.
\
\ For the variant of the game on Ian Bell's website, the ELA and ELB files are
\ not used, and instead CODE1 and CODE2 are loaded directly from disk and are
\ moved to their correct addressses by a simple mover program. See the
\ elite-mover.asm source for details.
\
\ For the source disk variant, the process is different, as the game isn't run
\ on an Apple II, but instead it's transmitted across a cable from the BBC Micro
\ development machine to the test Apple II machine. The transfer process goes
\ like this:
\
\   * ELA is transmitted first, which loads the game data at &0B60, the loading
\     screen at &2000 and CODE2 at &9000 to &BFFF.
\
\   * The ENTRY routine in ELA (i.e. this routine) is called on the Apple II,
\     which copies CODE2 into bank-switched RAM at &D000.
\
\   * ELB is transmitted next, which loads CODE1 from &4000 to &8FFF.
\
\   * The S% routine in ELB is called on the Apple II, which copies CODE2 out of
\     bank-switched RAM back to &9000 to &BFFF.
\
\ We don't have copies of the transfer software - there are some tantalising
\ clues in the S.APMAKES BASIC program, which includes a *APPLE command that is
\ presumably part of the transfer process - but I'm assumimg this memory-moving
\ process ensures that CODE2 doesn't get corrupted by the second transfer
\ process.
\
\ Interestingly, this routine is run by all variants of the game when ELA is
\ loaded, so the released game also copies CODE2 into bank-switched RAM when it
\ loads. The only difference is that the copied code is ignored in the released
\ game.
