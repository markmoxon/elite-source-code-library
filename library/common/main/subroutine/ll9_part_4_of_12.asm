\   Category: Drawing ships
\    Summary: Draw ship: Set visibility for exploding ship (all faces visible)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part sets up the visibility block in XX2 for a ship that is exploding.
\
\ The XX2 block consists of one byte for each face in the ship's blueprint,
\ which holds the visibility of that face. Because the ship is exploding, we
\ want to set all the faces to be visible. A value of 255 in the visibility
\ table means the face is visible, so the following code sets each face to 255
\ and then skips over the face visibility calculations that we would apply to a
\ non-exploding ship.
\

 LDA (XX0),Y            \ Fetch byte #12 of the ship's blueprint, which contains
                        \ the number of faces * 4

 LSR A                  \ Set X = A / 4
 LSR A                  \       = the number of faces
 TAX

 LDA #255               \ Set A = 255

 STA XX2,X              \ Set the X-th byte of XX2 to 255

 DEX                    \ Decrement the loop counter

 BPL EE30               \ Loop back for the next byte until there is one byte
                        \ set to 255 for each face

 INX                    \ Set XX4 = 0 for the distance value we use to test
 STX XX4                \ for visibility, so we always shows everything

                        \ as we don't need to do them now we've set up the XX2
                        \ block for the explosion
