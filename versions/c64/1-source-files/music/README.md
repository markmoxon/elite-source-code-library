# Music binaries for the Commodore 64 version of Elite

This folder contains the music binaries from the original game disk for the Commodore 64 version of Elite on Ian Bell's personal website.

* [C.COMUDAT.bin](C.COMUDAT.bin) contains the music data for the Blue Danube docking music; it is a compressed version of the C.MUSDAT music file (the compression is done by the S.MUCOMPR program on the source disk)

* [C.THEME.bin](C.THEME.bin) contains the music data for the Elite theme tune

Right on, Commanders!
