\    Summary: The key logger
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ KEYLOOK (also known as KLO) is the Commodore 64 version's key logger. It does
\ the same job as the KL key logger in the BBC Micro versions, but it has a very
\ different structure, with one entry for every possible key press, rather than
\ just one for each flight key.
\
\ Specifically, it has one byte for each key in the Commodore 64 keyboard
\ matrix, and it is laid out in the same order. The keyboard matrix is exposed
\ to our code via port A on the CIA1 interface chip, through the memory-mapped
\ locations &DC00 and &DC01. To read a key, you first set the column to scan by
\ writing to &DC00, and the details of any key that is bring pressed in that
\ column are returned in &DC01 (see the RDKEY routine for details).
\
\ The keyboard matrix layout can be seen at https://sta.c64.org/cbm64kbdlay.html
\
\ The KEYLOOK table mirrors the structure of the keyboard matrix, though it's
\ reversed so that KEYLOOK maps to the keyboard matrix from the bottom corner of
\ the above diagram, working right to left and down to up. (The RDKEY routine
\ is responsible for filling the KEYLOOK table, and it chooses to work through
\ the table in this direction).
\
\ The RDKEY routine scans the keyboard matrix and sets each entry in KEYLOOK
\ according to whether that key is being pressed. The entries that map to the
\ flight keys have labels KY1 through KY7 for the main flight controls, and
\ KY12 to KY20 for the secondary controls, so the main game code can check
\ whether a key is being pressed by simply checking for non-zero values in the
\ relevant KY entries. The order of the KY labels is strange because they are
\ the same labels as in the BBC Micro version, and the order of the keys in
\ the logger is completely different on the Commodore 64 (the labels are ordered
\ from KY1 to KY7 and KY12 to KY20 in the BBC Micro version).
\
\ The index of a key in the KEYLOOK table is referred to as the "internal key
\ number" throughout this documentation, so the "@" key has an internal key
\ number of 18 (or &12), for example, as it is stored at KEYLOOK+18.
\
\ Note that the initial content of the KEYLOOK table is a simple repeated string
\ of "123456789ABCDEF0", as this was used in the original source code to create
\ the table during assembly. These initial values have no meaning.
