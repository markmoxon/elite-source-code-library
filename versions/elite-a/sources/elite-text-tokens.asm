\ ELITE-A RECURSIVE TEXT TOKEN FILE
\
\ Elite-A is an extended version of BBC Micro Elite by Angus Duggan
\
\ The original Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright
\ Acornsoft 1984, and the extra code in Elite-A is copyright Angus Duggan
\
\ The code on this site is identical to Angus Duggan's source discs (it's just
\ been reformatted and variable names changed to be more readable)
\
\ The commentary is copyright Mark Moxon, and any misunderstandings or mistakes
\ in the documentation are entirely my fault

\
\ This source file produces the following binary file:
\
\   * output/WORDS.bin
\
\ This gets loaded as part of elite-loader.asm and gets moved to &0400 during
\ the loading process.
\
\ The binary file also includes the sine and arctan tables, so the three parts
\ end up as follows:
\
\   * Recursive token table:    QQ18 = &0400 to &07FF
\   * Sine lookup table:        SNE  = &07C0 to &07DF
\   * Arctan lookup table:      ACT  = &07E0 to &07FF
