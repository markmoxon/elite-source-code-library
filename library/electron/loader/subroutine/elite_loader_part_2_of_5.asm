\       Name: Elite loader (Part 2 of 5)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Loader
\    Summary: Perform a number of OS calls, set up sound, push routines on stack
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part of the loader does a number of calls to OS routines, sets up the
\ sound envelopes, and pushes 33 bytes onto the stack. A lot of the code in this
\ routine has been removed or hobbled to remove the protection; for a full
\ picture of the protection that's missing, see the source code for the BBC
\ Micro cassette version, which contains almost exactly the same protection code
\ as the original Electron version.
