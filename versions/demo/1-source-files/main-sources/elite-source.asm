\    Summary: Work out if we have space for a specific amount of cargo
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a market item and an amount, work out whether there is room in the
\ cargo hold for this item.
\
\ For standard tonne canisters, the limit is given by the type of cargo hold we
\ have, with a standard cargo hold having a capacity of 20t and an extended
\ cargo bay being 35t.
\
\ For items measured in kg (gold, platinum), g (gem-stones) and alien items,
\ the individual limit on each of these is 200 units.
\

\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2
\  s2 = tmp + s1
\
\ So this is what we do in this routine, where each seed is a 16-bit number.

\    Summary: Calculate (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division of a specified value from one of the
\ orientation vectors (in this example, nosev_x):
\
\   (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ where z is the z-coordinate of the planet from INWK. The result is an 8-bit
\ magnitude in A, with maximum value 254, and just a sign bit (bit 7) in Y.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 9, 11, 13: divides nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z
\
\                         * X = 15, 17, 19: divides roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z
\
\                         * X = 21, 23, 25: divides sidev_x, sidev_y, sidev_z
\

\    Summary: Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse
\  Deep dive: Drawing ellipses
\             Drawing meridians and equators
\             Drawing craters
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse, to be used for the planet's equator and
\ meridian (in which case we draw half an ellipse), or crater (in which case we
\ draw a full ellipse).
\
\ The ellipse is defined by a centre point, plus two conjugate radius vectors,
\ u and v, where:
\
\   u = [ u_x ]       v = [ v_x ]
\       [ u_y ]           [ v_y ]
\
\ The individual components of these 2D vectors (i.e. u_x, u_y etc.) are 16-bit
\ sign-magnitude numbers, where the high bytes contain only the sign bit (in
\ bit 7), with bits 0 to 6 being clear. This means that as we store u_x as
\ (XX16 K2), for example, we know that |u_x| = K2.
\
\ This routine calls BLINE to draw each line segment in the ellipse, passing the
\ coordinates as follows:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + u_x * cos(CNT2) + v_x * sin(CNT2)
\
\   K6(3 2) = K4(1 0) - u_y * cos(CNT2) - v_y * sin(CNT2)
\
\ The y-coordinates are negated because BLINE expects pixel coordinates but the
\ u and v vectors are extracted from the orientation vector. The y-axis runs
\ in the opposite direction in 3D space to that on the screen, so we need to
\ negate the 3D space coordinates before we can combine them with the ellipse's
\ centre coordinates.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K(1 0)              The planet's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             The pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   K4(1 0)             The pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   (XX16 K2)           The x-component of u (i.e. u_x), where XX16 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+1 K2+1)       The y-component of u (i.e. u_y), where XX16+1 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+2 K2+2)       The x-component of v (i.e. v_x), where XX16+2 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\

\

\
\                         * 32 for a half ellipse (a meridian)
\
\                         * 64 for a full ellipse (a crater)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\
\ Calculate the following, with X determining the vector to use:

\
\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the

 LDA (SC),Y             \ Fetch byte #35 of the source's ship data block at SC,

                        \ go...

 LDA SC+1               \ the next iteration
 STA INF+1

 LDY T                  \ Now we want to move the contents of the heap, as all

                        \
                        \ As a reminder, we have already set the following:

                        \

.KSL3

\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the high nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the low nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Work out how bad we are from the amount of contraband in our hold. The
\ formula is:

\   (slaves + narcotics) * 2 + firearms
\
\ so slaves and narcotics are twice as illegal as firearms. The value in FIST
\ (our legal status) is set to at least this value whenever we launch from a

\ station carrying 25 tonnes of slaves/narcotics, or 50 tonnes of firearms
\ across multiple trips, is enough to make us a fugitive.

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Geometry)
\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in a number of places: when drawing the compass,
\ when applying AI tactics to ships (so traders fly towards planets and missiles
\ fly towards their targets, for example), and when implementing the docking
\ computer in the enhanced versions of Elite.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3(2 1 0)           The 16-bit x-coordinate as (x_sign x_hi x_lo), where
\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15

\    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see page 142 of the
\ "Advanced User Guide for the BBC Micro" by Bray, Dickens and Holmes for a list
\ of internal key numbers). We pass the key that has been pressed in X, and the
\ configuration option to check it against in Y, so this routine is typically
\ called in a loop that loops through the various configuration options.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The internal number of the key that's been pressed
\
\   Y                   The internal number of the configuration key to check
\                       against, from the list above (i.e. Y must be from &40 to
\                       &46)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the

\
\ This part sets up the visibility block in XX2 for a ship that is exploding.
\
\ The XX2 block consists of one byte for each face in the ship's blueprint,
\ which holds the visibility of that face. Because the ship is exploding, we
\ want to set all the faces to be visible. A value of 255 in the visibility
\ table means the face is visible, so the following code sets each face to 255
\ and then skips over the face visibility calculations that we would apply to a
\ non-exploding ship.
