\    Summary: Clear the bottom three text rows of the mode 4 screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Clear some space at the bottom of the screen and move the text cursor to
\ column 1, row 21. Specifically, this zeroes the following screen locations:
\
\   &7507 to &75F0
\   &7607 to &76F0
\   &7707 to &77F0
\
\ which clears the three bottom text rows of the mode 4 screen (rows 21 to 23),
\ clearing each row from text column 1 to 30 (so it doesn't overwrite the box
\ border in columns 0 and 32, or the last usable column in column 31).
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   A is set to 0
\
\   Y                   Y is set to 0
