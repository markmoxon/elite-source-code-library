\       Name: MVEIT (Part 8 of 9)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Moving
\    Summary: Move current ship: Rotate ship about itself by its own pitch/roll
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine has multiple stages. This stage does the following:
\
\   * If the ship we are processing is rolling or pitching itself, rotate it and
\     apply damping if required
\
