\       Name: DELAY
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: Wait for a specified time, in 1/50s of a second
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Wait for the number of vertical syncs given in Y, so this effectively waits
\ for Y/50 of a second (as the vertical sync occurs 50 times a second).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The number of vertical sync events to wait for
\
IF _CASSETTE_VERSION \ Comment
\ Other entry points:
\
\   DEL8                Wait for 8/50 of a second (0.16 seconds)
\
\   DELAY-5             Wait for 2/50 of a second (0.04 seconds).
