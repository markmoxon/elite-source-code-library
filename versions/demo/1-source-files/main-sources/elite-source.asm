\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.

\
\ Arguments:

\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line

\

\
