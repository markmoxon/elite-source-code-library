 SKIP 4                 \ The specifications of the lasers fitted to each of the
                        \ four space views:
                        \
                        \   * Byte #0 = front view (red key f0)
                        \   * Byte #1 = rear view (red key f1)
                        \   * Byte #2 = left view (red key f2)
                        \   * Byte #3 = right view (red key f3)
                        \
                        \ For each of the views:
                        \
                        \   * 0 = no laser is fitted to this view
                        \
                        \   * Non-zero = a laser is fitted to this view, with
                        \     the following specification:
                        \
                        \     * Bits 0-6 contain the laser's power
                        \
                        \     * Bit 7 determines whether or not the laser pulses
                        \       (pulse laser) or is always on (beam laser)
