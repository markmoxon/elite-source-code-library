\       Name: LOIN (Part 4 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a shallow line going right and down or left and up
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going right and down (no swap) or left and up (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1-1 <= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right

.DOWN

 LDA SWAP               \ If SWAP = 0 then we didn't swap the coordinates above,
 BEQ LI9                \ so jump down to LI9 to skip plotting the first pixel

 DEX                    \ Decrement the counter in X because we're about to plot
                        \ the first pixel

.LIL3

                        \ We now loop along the line from left to right, using X
                        \ as a decreasing counter, and at each count we plot a
                        \ single pixel using the pixel mask in R

 LDA R                  \ Fetch the pixel byte from R

 EOR (SC),Y             \ Store R into screen memory at SC(1 0), using EOR
 STA (SC),Y             \ logic so it merges with whatever is already on-screen

.LI9

 LSR R                  \ Shift the single pixel in R to the right to step along
                        \ the x-axis, so the next pixel we plot will be at the
                        \ next x-coordinate along

 BCC LI10               \ If the pixel didn't fall out of the right end of R
                        \ into the C flag, then jump to LI10

 ROR R                  \ Otherwise we need to move over to the next character
                        \ block, so first rotate R right so the set C flag goes
                        \ back into the left end, giving %10000000

 LDA SC                 \ Add 8 to SC, so SC(1 0) now points to the next
 ADC #8                 \ character along to the right
 STA SC

.LI10

 LDA S                  \ Set S = S + Q
 ADC Q
 STA S

 BCC LIC3               \ If the addition didn't overflow, jump to LIC3

 INY                    \ Otherwise we just overflowed, so increment Y to move
                        \ to the pixel line below

 CPY #8                 \ If Y < 8 we are still within the same character block,
 BNE LIC3               \ so skip to LIC3

 INC SCH                \ Otherwise we need to move down into the character
 LDY #0                 \ block below, so increment the high byte of the screen
                        \ address and set the pixel line to the first line in
                        \ that character block

.LIC3

 DEX                    \ Decrement the counter in X

 BNE LIL3               \ If we haven't yet reached the right end of the line,
                        \ loop back to LIL3 to plot the next pixel along

 LDY YSAV               \ Restore Y from YSAV, so that it's preserved

 RTS                    \ Return from the subroutine
