## Introduction

This repository contains the original source code for the cassette version of Elite on the BBC Micro, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.

You can build the fully functioning game from this source. [Three variants](#building-different-variants-of-the-cassette-version-of-elite) are currently supported: the tape version from the Stairway to Hell archive, the version produced by the original source discs from Ian Bell's personal website, and the version built from the text sources from the same site.

It is a companion to the [elite.bbcelite.com website](https://elite.bbcelite.com), which contains all the code from this repository, but laid out in a much more human-friendly fashion. The links at the top of this page will take you to repositories for the other versions of Elite that are covered by this project.

* If you want to browse the source and read about how Elite works under the hood, you will probably find [the website](https://elite.bbcelite.com) is a better place to start than this repository.

* If you would rather explore the source code in your favourite IDE, then the [annotated source](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source.asm) is what you're looking for. It contains the exact same content as the website, so you won't be missing out (the website is generated from the source files, so they are guaranteed to be identical). You might also like to read the section on [browsing the source in an IDE](#browsing-the-source-in-an-ide) for some tips.

* If you want to build BBC Micro cassette Elite from the source on a modern computer, to produce a working game disc that can be loaded into a BBC Micro or an emulator, then you want the section on [building BBC Micro cassette Elite from the source](#building-bbc-micro-cassette-elite-from-the-source).

My hope is that this repository and the [accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com) will be useful for those who want to learn more about Elite and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate one of the most iconic games of the 8-bit era.

### A note on licences, copyright etc.

This repository is _not_ provided with a licence, and there is intentionally no `LICENSE` file provided.

According to [GitHub's licensing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository), this means that "the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work".

The reason for this is that my commentary is intertwined with the original Elite source code, and the original source code is copyright. The whole site is therefore covered by default copyright law, to ensure that this copyright is respected.

Under GitHub's rules, you have the right to read and fork this repository... but that's it. No other use is permitted, I'm afraid.

My hope is that the educational and non-profit intentions of this repository will enable it to stay hosted and available, but the original copyright holders do have the right to ask for it to be taken down, in which case I will comply without hesitation. I do hope, though, that along with the various other disassemblies and commentaries of this source, it will remain viable.

## Browsing the source in an IDE

If you want to browse the source in an IDE, you might find the following useful.

* The most interesting files are in the [main-sources](1-source-files/main-sources) folder:

  * The main game's source code is in the [elite-source.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source.asm) file - this is the motherlode and probably contains all the stuff you're interested in.

  * The game's loader is in the [elite-loader.asm](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-loader.asm) file - this is mainly concerned with setup and copy protection.

* It's probably worth skimming through the [notes on terminology and notations](https://elite.bbcelite.com/terminology/) on the accompanying website, as this explains a number of terms used in the commentary, without which it might be a bit tricky to follow at times (in particular, you should understand the terminology I use for multi-byte numbers).

* The accompanying website contains [a number of "deep dive" articles](https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/), each of which goes into an aspect of the game in detail. Routines that are explained further in these articles are tagged with the label `Deep dive:` and the relevant article name.

* There are loads of routines and variables in Elite - literally hundreds. You can find them in the source files by searching for the following: `Type: Subroutine`, `Type: Variable`, `Type: Workspace` and `Type: Macro`.

* If you know the name of a routine, you can find it by searching for `Name: <name>`, as in `Name: SCAN` (for the 3D scanner routine) or `Name: LL9` (for the ship-drawing routine).

* The entry point for the [main game code](1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source.asm) is routine `TT170`, which you can find by searching for `Name: TT170`. If you want to follow the program flow all the way from the title screen around the main game loop, then you can find a number of [deep dives on program flow](https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/) on the accompanying website.

* The source code is designed to be read at an 80-column width and with a monospaced font, just like in the good old days.

I hope you enjoy exploring the inner workings of BBC Elite as much as I have.

## Folder structure

There are five main folders in this repository, which reflect the order of the build process.

* [1-source-files](1-source-files) contains all the different source files, such as the main assembler source files, image binaries, fonts, boot files and so on.

* [2-build-files](2-build-files) contains build-related scripts, such as the checksum, encryption and crc32 verification scripts.

* [3-assembled-output](3-assembled-output) contains the output from the assembly process, when the source files are assembled and the results processed by the build files.

* [4-reference-binaries](4-reference-binaries) contains the correct binaries for each variant, so we can verify that our assembled output matches the reference.

* [5-compiled-game-discs](5-compiled-game-discs) contains the final output of the build process: an SSD disc image that contains the compiled game and which can be run on real hardware or in an emulator.

## Flicker-free Elite

This repository also includes a flicker-free version, which incorporates the backported flicker-free ship-drawing routines from the BBC Master. The flicker-free code is in a separate branch called `flicker-free`, and apart from the code differences for reducing flicker, this branch is identical to the main branch and the same build process applies.

The annotated source files in the `flicker-free` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications for flicker-free Elite, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the flicker-free binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

For more information on flicker-free Elite, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/flicker-free_elite.html).

## Elite Compendium

This repository also includes a version of BBC Micro cassette Elite for the Elite Compendium, which incorporates all the available hacks in one game. The Compendium version is in a separate branch called `elite-compendium`, which is included in the [Elite Compendium (BBC Micro)](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-compendium-bbc-micro) repository as a submodule.

The annotated source files in the `elite-compendium` branch contain both the original Acornsoft code and all of the modifications for the Elite Compendium, so you can look through the source to see exactly what's changed. Any code that I've removed from the original version is commented out in the source files, so when they are assembled they produce the Compendium binaries, while still containing details of all the modifications. You can find all the diffs by searching the sources for `Mod:`.

For more information on the Elite Compendium, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/elite_compendium.html).

## Building BBC Micro cassette Elite from the source

Builds are supported for both Windows and Mac/Linux systems. In all cases the build process is defined in the `Makefile` provided.

### Requirements

You will need the following to build BBC Micro cassette Elite from the source:

* BeebAsm, which can be downloaded from the [BeebAsm repository](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm). Mac and Linux users will have to build their own executable with `make code`, while Windows users can just download the `beebasm.exe` file.

* Python. The build process has only been tested on 3.x, but 2.7 might work.

* Mac and Linux users may need to install `make` if it isn't already present (for Windows users, `make.exe` is included in this repository).

For details of how the build process works, see the [build documentation on bbcelite.com](https://elite.bbcelite.com/about_site/building_elite.html).

Let's look at how to build BBC Micro cassette Elite from the source.

### Windows

For Windows users, there is a batch file called `make.bat` which you can use to build the game. Before this will work, you should edit the batch file and change the values of the `BEEBASM` and `PYTHON` variables to point to the locations of your `beebasm.exe` and `python.exe` executables. You also need to change directory to the repository folder (i.e. the same folder as `make.bat`).

All being well, entering the following into a command window:

```
make.bat
```

will produce a file called `elite-cassette-sth.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the source disc variant, which you can then load into an emulator, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

### Mac and Linux

The build process uses a standard GNU `Makefile`, so you just need to install `make` if your system doesn't already have it. If BeebAsm or Python are not on your path, then you can either fix this, or you can edit the `Makefile` and change the `BEEBASM` and `PYTHON` variables in the first two lines to point to their locations. You also need to change directory to the repository folder (i.e. the same folder as `Makefile`).

All being well, entering the following into a terminal window:

```
make
```

will produce a file called `elite-cassette-sth.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the source disc variant, which you can then load into an emulator, or into a real BBC Micro using a device like a Gotek.

### Build options

By default the build process will create a typical Elite game disc with a standard commander and verified binaries. There are various arguments you can pass to the build to change how it works. They are:

* `variant=<name>` - Build the specified variant:

  * `variant=sth` (default)
  * `variant=source-disc`
  * `variant=text-sources`

* `disc=no` - Build a version to load from cassette rather than disc (the default is to build a version that loads from disc)

* `protect=no` - When building for cassette with `disc=no`, the loader contains block-level tape protection code, which you can disable with this argument (the protection only works if you save the ELITEcode file to tape with corrupted block data, so if you want to create a UEF without re-implementing the Acornsoft protection system, you should use this argument)

* `commander=max` - Start with a maxed-out commander (specifically, this is the test commander file from the original source, which is almost but not quite maxed-out)

* `encrypt=no` - Disable encryption and checksum routines

* `verify=no` - Disable crc32 verification of the game binaries

So, for example:

`make variant=text-sources commander=max encrypt=no match=no verify=no`

will build an unencrypted text sources variant with a maxed-out commander, no workspace noise and no crc32 verification.

The unencrypted version should be more useful for anyone who wants to make modifications to the game code. As this argument produces unencrypted files, the binaries produced will be quite different to the binaries on the original source disc, which are encrypted.

See below for more on the verification process.

### Updating the checksum scripts if you change the code

If you change the source code in any way, you may break the game; if so, it will typically hang at the loading screen, though in some versions it may hang when launching from the space station.

To fix this, you may need to update some of the hard-coded addresses in the checksum script so that they match the new addresses in your changed version of the code. See the comments in the [elite-checksum.py](2-build-files/elite-checksum.py) script for details.

### Verifying the output

The default build process prints out checksums of all the generated files, along with the checksums of the files from the original sources. You can disable verification by passing `verify=no` to the build.

The Python script `crc32.py` in the `2-build-files` folder does the actual verification, and shows the checksums and file sizes of both sets of files, alongside each other, and with a Match column that flags any discrepancies. If you are building an unencrypted set of files then there will be lots of differences, while the encrypted files should mostly match (see the Differences section below for more on this).

The binaries in the `4-reference-binaries` folder were taken straight from the [cassette sources disc image](http://www.elitehomepage.org/archive/a/a4080602.zip), while those in the `3-assembled-output` folder are produced by the build process. For example, if you don't make any changes to the code and build the project with `make`, then this is the output of the verification process:

```
Results for variant: sth
[--originals--]  [---output----]

c4547e5e   1023  c4547e5e   1023   Yes   WORDS9.bin
```

All the compiled binaries match the originals, so we know we are producing the same final game as the Stairway to Hell variant.

### Log files

During compilation, details of every step are output in a file called `compile.txt` in the `3-assembled-output` folder. If you have problems, it might come in handy, and it's a great reference if you need to know the addresses of labels and variables for debugging (or just snooping around).

### Auto-deploying to the b2 emulator

For users of the excellent [b2 emulator](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2), you can include the build parameter `b2` to automatically load and boot the assembled disc image in b2. The b2 emulator must be running for this to work.

For example, to build, verify and load the game into b2, you can do this on Windows:

```
make.bat all b2
```

or this on Mac/Linux:

```
make all b2
```

If you omit the `all` target then b2 will start up with the results of the last successful build.

Note that you should manually choose the correct platform in b2 (I intentionally haven't automated this part to make it easier to test across multiple platforms).

### Building a UEF tape image

Despite this being the cassette version of BBC Micro Elite, this repository only builds disc images by default, as that's how BeebAsm works. If you want the authentic experience of loading Elite from cassette, then you can build a UEF with the following command on Windows:

```
make.bat uef disc=no protect=no
```

or this on Mac/Linux:

```
make uef disc=no protect=no
```

You should now be able to load Elite from your UEF on a BBC Micro, by entering `CHAIN "ELITE"`. These UEF tape images will work with emulators and the TZXDuino (though you may need to unzip them before they will work with the latter).

For this to work, you will need PHP installed, and you should edit the `Makefile` (and `make.bat` on Windows) to point to PHP (specifically, you'll need to point the `PHP` variable to point to the locations of your `php` or `php.exe` binary).

Note that in order for your UEF to work, you need to include the `disc=no` and `protect=no` arguments to the build (as above). This ensures that the binaries are built to load at the correct address for tape systems, and it also disables the block-level tape protection system, as this only works with specially created tape images, like the ones that Acornsoft originally released.

## Building different variants of the cassette version of Elite

This repository contains the source code for three different variants of the cassette version of Elite:

* The variant from the Stairway to Hell archive

* The variant produced by the original source discs from Ian Bell's personal website

* The variant built from the text sources from the same site

By default the build process builds the Stairway to Hell variant, but you can build a specified variant using the `variant=` build parameter.

### Building the Stairway to Hell variant

You can add `variant=source-disc` to produce the `elite-cassette-from-source-disc.ssd` file containing the source disc variant, though that's the default value so it isn't necessary. In other words, you can build it like this:

```
make.bat variant=sth
```

or this on a Mac or Linux:

```
make variant=sth
```

This will produce a file called `elite-cassette-sth.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the Stairway to Hell variant.

The verification checksums for this version are as follows:

```
Results for variant: sth
[--originals--]  [---output----]

c4547e5e   1023  c4547e5e   1023   Yes   WORDS9.bin
```

Note that if you add the `disc=no` build parameter, then the build will produce binaries that are designed to be loaded from cassette rather than disc. The verification step will compare the results to the exact binaries from the UEF from the Stairway to Hell archive. These binaries have block-level tape protection enabled by default, so they will not match. You can override the block-level protection with `protect=no`.

### Building the source disc variant

You can build the source disc variant by appending `variant=source-disc` to the `make` command, like this on Windows:

```
make.bat variant=source-disc
```

or this on a Mac or Linux:

```
make variant=source-disc
```

This will produce a file called `elite-cassette-from-source-disc.ssd` in the `5-compiled-game-discs` folder that contains the source disc variant.

The verification checksums for this version are as follows:

```

### Building the text sources variant

You can build the text sources variant by appending `variant=text-sources` to the `make` command, like this on Windows:

```
make.bat variant=text-sources
```

or this on a Mac or Linux:

```

### Differences between the variants

You can see the differences between the variants by searching the source code for `_STH_CASSETTE` (for features in the Stairway to Hell variant), `_SOURCE_DISC` (for features in the source disc variant) or `_TEXT_SOURCES` (for features in the text sources variant). There are only minor differences:

* The text sources contain an extra call in the galactic hyperspace routine that sets the current system to the nearest system to the crosshairs, in an attempt to fix a bug in the original source disc variant (though it doesn't quite fix it properly).

* The Stairway to Hell variant contains the extra call in the galactic hyperspace routine, but in a different place, and it also zeroes the distance to the current system in QQ8. This fixes the galactic hyperspace bug properly, and this full bug fix is present in all other versions of the game.

* In order to fit in this extra call, the text sources and Stairway to Hell variants also contain modifications to create space for the call.

* There is a small change in the TTX66 routine to reset LAS2 to 0 instead of LASCT to stop laser pulsing, as this is slightly more efficient.

See the [accompanying website](https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/releases.html) for a comprehensive list of differences between the variants.

## Notes on the original source files

### Fixing a bug in the source disc

It also turns out there are two versions of the `ELITEB` BASIC source program on the [cassette sources disc image](http://www.elitehomepage.org/archive/a/a4080602.zip), one called `$.ELITEB` and another called `O.ELITEB`. These two versions of `ELITEB` differ by just one byte in the default commander data. This byte controls whether or not the commander has a rear pulse laser. In `O.ELITEB` this byte is generated by:

```
EQUB (POW + 128) AND Q%
```

while in `$.ELITEB`, this byte is generated by:

```
EQUB POW
```

The BASIC variable `Q%` is a Boolean flag that, if `TRUE`, will create a default commander with lots of cash and equipment, which is useful for testing. You can see this in action if you build an unencrypted binary with `make build`, as the unencrypted build sets `Q%` to `TRUE` for this build target.

The BASIC variable `POW` has a value of 15, which is the power of a pulse laser. `POW + 128`, meanwhile, is the power of a beam laser.

Given the above, we can see that `O.ELITEB` correctly produces a default commander with no a rear laser if `Q%` is `FALSE`, but adds a rear beam laser if `Q%` is `TRUE`. This matches the default commander from the released game, and produces the `ELTcode` executable on the same disc. The version of `ELITEB` in the [cassette sources as text files](http://www.elitehomepage.org/archive/a/a4080610.zip) matches this version, `O.ELITEB`.

In contrast, `$.ELITEB` will always produce a default commander with a rear pulse laser, irrespective of the setting of `Q%`, so it doesn't match the released version.

The `ELTB` binary file in the `4-reference-binaries` folder of this repository matches the version generated by the source disc, so we can easily tell whether any changes we've made to the code deviate from this version. However, the `ELTB` binary file on the sources disc matches the version produced by `$.ELITEB`, rather than the version produced by `O.ELITEB` - in other words, `ELTB` on the source disc is not the version generated by the source code on the same disc.

The implication is that the `ELTB` binary file on the [cassette sources disc image](http://www.elitehomepage.org/archive/a/a4080602.zip) was produced by `$.ELITEB`, while the `ELTcode` file (the released game) used `O.ELITEB`. Perhaps the released game was compiled, and then someone backed up the `ELITEB` source to `O.ELITEB`, edited the `$.ELITEB` to have a rear pulse laser, and then generated a new `ELTB` binary file. Who knows? Unfortunately, files on DFS discs don't have timestamps, so it's hard to tell.

Right on, Commanders!
