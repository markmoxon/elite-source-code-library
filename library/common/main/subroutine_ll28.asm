\       Name: LL28
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Arithmetic)
\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the
\                       division will work
