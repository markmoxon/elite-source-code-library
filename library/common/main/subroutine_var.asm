\    Summary: Calculate QQ19+3 = economy * |economic_factor|
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set QQ19+3 = economy * |economic_factor|, given byte #1 of the market prices
\ table for an item. Also sets the availability of Alien Items to 0.
\
\ This routine forms part of the calculations for market item prices (TT151)
\ and availability (GVL).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   QQ19+1              Byte #1 of the market prices table for this market item
\                       (which contains the economic_factor in bits 0-5, and the
\                       sign of the economic_factor in bit 7)

.var

 LDA QQ19+1             \ Extract bits 0-5 from QQ19+1 into A, to get the
 AND #31                \ economic_factor without its sign, in other words:
                        \
                        \   A = |economic_factor|

 LDY QQ28               \ Set Y to the economy byte of the current system

 STA QQ19+2             \ Store A in QQ19+2

 CLC                    \ Clear the C flag so we can do additions below

 LDA #0                 \ Set AVL+16 (availability of Alien Items) to 0,
 STA AVL+16             \ setting A to 0 in the process

.TT153

                        \ We now do the multiplication by doing a series of
                        \ additions in a loop, building the result in A. Each
                        \ loop adds QQ19+2 (|economic_factor|) to A, and it
                        \ loops the number of times given by the economy byte;
                        \ in other words, because A starts at 0, this sets:
                        \
                        \   A = economy * |economic_factor|

 DEY                    \ Decrement the economy in Y, exiting the loop when it
 BMI TT154              \ becomes negative

 ADC QQ19+2             \ Add QQ19+2 to A

 JMP TT153              \ Loop back to TT153 to do another addition

.TT154

 STA QQ19+3             \ Store the result in QQ19+3

 RTS                    \ Return from the subroutine
