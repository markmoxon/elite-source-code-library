\    Summary: Print the captain's name during mission briefings
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine prints the following tokens, depending on the galaxy number:
\
\   * Token 217 ("CURRUTHERS") in galaxy 0
\
\   * Token 218 ("FOSDYKE SMYTHE") in galaxy 1
\
\   * Token 219 ("FORTESQUE") in galaxy 2
\
\ This is used when printing extended token 213 as part of the mission
\ briefings, which looks like this when printed:
\
\   Commander {commander name}, I am Captain {mission captain's name} of Her
\   Majesty's Space Navy
\
\ where {mission captain's name} is replaced by one of the names above.

 LDA #217               \ Set A = 217, so when we fall through into MT28, the
                        \ 217 gets added to the current galaxy number, so the
                        \ extended token that is printed is 217-219 (as this is
                        \ only called in galaxies 0 through 2)
