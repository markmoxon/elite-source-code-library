\       Name: LOIN (Part 6 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and left or down and right
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and left (no swap) or down and right (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right

 CLC                    \ Clear the C flag

 LDA SWAP               \ If SWAP = 0 then we didn't swap the coordinates above,
 BEQ LI17               \ so jump down to LI17 to skip plotting the first pixel

 DEX                    \ Decrement the counter in X because we're about to plot
                        \ the first pixel

.LIL5

                        \ We now loop along the line from left to right, using X
                        \ as a decreasing counter, and at each count we plot a
                        \ single pixel using the pixel mask in R

 LDA R                  \ Fetch the pixel byte from R

 EOR (SC),Y             \ Store R into screen memory at SC(1 0), using EOR
 STA (SC),Y             \ logic so it merges with whatever is already on-screen

.LI17

 DEY                    \ Decrement Y to step up along the y-axis

 BPL LI16               \ If Y is positive we are still within the same
                        \ character block, so skip to LI16

 DEC SCH                \ Otherwise we need to move up into the character block
 LDY #7                 \ above, so decrement the high byte of the screen
                        \ address and set the pixel line to the last line in
                        \ that character block

.LI16

 LDA S                  \ Set S = S + P
 ADC P
 STA S

 BCC LIC5               \ If the addition didn't overflow, jump to LIC5

 LSR R                  \ Otherwise we just overflowed, so shift the single
                        \ pixel in R to the right, so the next pixel we plot
                        \ will be at the next x-coordinate along

 BCC LIC5               \ If the pixel didn't fall out of the right end of R
                        \ into the C flag, then jump to LIC5

 ROR R                  \ Otherwise we need to move over to the next character
                        \ block, so first rotate R right so the set C flag goes
                        \ back into the left end, giving %10000000

 LDA SC                 \ Add 8 to SC, so SC(1 0) now points to the next
 ADC #8                 \ character along to the right
 STA SC

.LIC5

 DEX                    \ Decrement the counter in X

 BNE LIL5               \ If we haven't yet reached the right end of the line,
                        \ loop back to LIL5 to plot the next pixel along

 LDY YSAV               \ Restore Y from YSAV, so that it's preserved

 RTS                    \ Return from the subroutine
