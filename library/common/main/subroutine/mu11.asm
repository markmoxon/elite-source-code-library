\       Name: MU11
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Arithmetic)
\    Summary: Calculate (A P) = P * X
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of two unsigned 8-bit numbers:
\
\   (A P) = P * X
\
\ This uses the same shift-and-add approach as MULT1, but it's simpler as we
\ are dealing with unsigned numbers in P and X. See the deep dive on
\ "Shift-and-add multiplication" for a discussion of how this algorithm works.

                        \ We subtract 1 as the C flag will be set when we want
                        \ to do an addition in the loop below

 LDA #0                 \ Set A = 0 so we can start building the answer in A

 LDX #8                 \ Set up a counter in X to count the 8 bits in P

 LSR P                  \ Set P = P >> 1
                        \ and C flag = bit 0 of P

                        \ We are now going to work our way through the bits of
                        \ P, and do a shift-add for any bits that are set,
                        \ keeping the running total in A. We just did the first
                        \ shift right, so we now need to do the first add and
                        \ loop through the other bits in P

 ROR A                  \ Shift A right to catch the next digit of our result,
                        \ which the next ROR sticks into the left end of P while
                        \ also extracting the next bit of P

 ROR P                  \ Add the overspill from shifting A to the right onto
                        \ the start of P, and shift P right to fetch the next
                        \ bit for the calculation into the C flag
