\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Arithmetic)
\    Summary: Calculate A = x_hi^2 + y_hi^2 + z_hi^2 in the K% block
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a value in Y that points to the start of a ship data block as an offset
\ from K%, calculate the following:
\
\   A = x_hi^2 + y_hi^2 + z_hi^2
\
\ returning A = &FF if the calculation overflows a one-byte result. The K%
\ workspace contains the ship data blocks, so the offset in Y must be 0 or a
\ multiple of NI% (as each block in K% contains NI% bytes).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The offset from K% for the start of the ship data block
\                       to use
\
\ Returns
\
\   A                   A = x_hi^2 + y_hi^2 + z_hi^2
\
\                       A = &FF if the calculation overflows a one-byte result
