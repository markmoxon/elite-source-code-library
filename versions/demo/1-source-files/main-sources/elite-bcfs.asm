\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called at LBL+1 from the CHECKER routine in the loader code in
\ elite-loader.asm. It calculates the checksum of the first two pages of the
\ loader code that was copied from UU% to LE% by part 3 of the loader, and
\ checks the result against the result in the first byte of the LE% block,
\ CHECKbyt, at address &0B00.

\ Other entry points:
\
\   LBL+2               Contains an RTS

                        \ decremented down to &6C, and this new value is then
                        \ included in the checksum calculation for the MAINSUM
                        \ checksum in the CHECKER routine (the value is set to
