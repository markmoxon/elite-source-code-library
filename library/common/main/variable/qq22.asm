 SKIP 2                 \ The two hyperspace countdown counters
                        \
                        \ Before a hyperspace jump, both QQ22 and QQ22+1 are
                        \ set to 15
                        \
                        \ QQ22 is an internal counter that counts down by 1
                        \ each time TT102 is called, which happens every
                        \ iteration of the main game loop. When it reaches
                        \ zero, the on-screen counter in QQ22+1 gets
                        \ decremented, and QQ22 gets set to 5 and the countdown
                        \ continues (so the first tick of the hyperspace counter
                        \ takes 15 iterations to happen, but subsequent ticks
                        \ take 5 iterations each)
                        \
                        \ QQ22+1 contains the number that's shown on-screen
                        \ during the countdown. It counts down from 15 to 1, and
                        \ when it hits 0, the hyperspace engines kick in
