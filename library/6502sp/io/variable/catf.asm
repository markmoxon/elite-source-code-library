 EQUB 0                 \ The disc catalogue flag
                        \
                        \ Determines whether a disc catalogue is currently in
                        \ progress, so the TT26 print routine can format the
                        \ output correctly:
                        \
                        \   * 0 = disc is not currently being catalogued
                        \
                        \   * 1 = disc is currently being catalogued
                        \
                        \ Specifically, when CATF is non-zero, TT26 will omit
                        \ column 17 from the catalogue so that it will fit
                        \ on-screen (column 17 is blank column in the middle
                        \ of the catalogue, between the two lists of filenames,
                        \ so it can be dropped without affecting the layout)
