 SKIP 1                 \ The "extra vessels" spawning counter
                        \
                        \ This counter is set to 0 on arrival in a system and
                        \ following an in-system jump, and is bumped up when we
                        \ spawn bounty hunters or pirates (i.e. "extra vessels")
                        \
                        \ It decreases by 1 each time we consider spawning more
                        \ "extra vessels" in part 4 of the main game loop, so
                        \ increasing the value of EV has the effect of delaying
                        \ the spawning of more vessels
                        \
                        \ In other words, this counter stops bounty hunters and
                        \ pirates from continually appearing, and ensures that
                        \ there's a delay between spawnings
