\       Name: DORND
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: Generate random numbers
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to random numbers. The C and V flags are also set randomly.
\
\ This is a simplified version of the DORND routine in the main game code. It
\ swaps the two calculations around and omits the ROL A instruction, but is
\ otherwise very similar. See the DORND routine in the main game code for more
\ details.
