\       Name: LOIN (Part 2 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a line: Line has a shallow gradient, step right along x-axis
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * |delta_y| < |delta_x|
\
\   * The line is closer to being horizontal than vertical
\
\   * We are going to step right along the x-axis
\
\   * We potentially swap coordinates to make sure X1 < X2
