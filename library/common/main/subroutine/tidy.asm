\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.
