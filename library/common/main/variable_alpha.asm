.ALPHA

 SKIP 1                 \ The current roll angle alpha, which is reduced from
                        \ JSTX to a sign-magnitude value between -31 and +31
                        \
                        \ This describes how fast we are rolling our ship, and
                        \ determines how fast the universe rolls around us
                        \
                        \ The sign bit is also stored in ALP2, while the
                        \ opposite sign is stored in ALP2+1
