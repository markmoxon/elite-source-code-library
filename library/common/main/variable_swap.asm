.SWAP

 SKIP 1                 \ Temporary storage, used to store a flag that records
                        \ whether or not we had to swap a line's start and end
                        \ coordinates around when clipping the line in routine
                        \ LL145 (the flag is used in places like BLINE to swap
                        \ them back)
