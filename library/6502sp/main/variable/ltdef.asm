\    Summary: Letter definitions for the Star Wars scroll text
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Letters in the scroll text are drawn on a 3x6 grid like this:
\
\   .   .   .
\   .   .   .
\   .   .   .
\   .   .   .
\   .   .   .
\   .   .   .
\
\ The spacing is configured like this:
\
\   0           .   .   .
\   0.5 * WY    .   .   .
\   1.0 * WY    .   .   .
\   1.5 * WY    .   .   .
\   2.0 * WY    .   .   .
\   2.5 * WY    .   .   .
\
\               4   8   12
\
\ so the vertical spacing is controlled by configuration variable WY. The
\ x-coordinate of point n is given by the n-th entry in NOFX, while the
\ y-coordinate is given by the n-th entry in NOFY.
\
\ When drawing letters, only 12 of the 18 points can be used. They are numbered
\ as follows:
\
\   0   1   2
\   .   .   .
\   3   4   5
\   .   .   .
\   6   7   8
\   9   A   B
\
\ The LTDEF table contains definitions for all the letters and some punctuation
\ characters. Each definition consists of 5 bytes, with each byte describing one
\ line in the character's shape (bytes with value 0 are ignored, so each
\ character consists of up to five lines).
\
\ The bottom nibble of each byte is the starting point for that line segment,
\ and the top nibble is the end point, so a value of &28, for example, means
\ "draw a line from point 8 to point 2").
\
\ Let's look at a few examples to make this clearer.
\
\ The definition in LTDEF for "A" is:
\
\   &60, &02, &28, &35, &00
\
\ This translates to the following:
\
\   &60 = line from point 0 to point 6
\   &02 = line from point 2 to point 0
\   &28 = line from point 8 to point 2
\   &35 = line from point 5 to point 3
\   &00 = ignore
\
\ which looks like this on the grid:
\
\   +-------+
\   |   .   |
\   +-------+
\   |   .   |
\   |   .   |
\   .   .   .
\
\ The definition in LTDEF for "S" is:
\
\   &20, &03, &35, &58, &86
\
\ This translates to the following:
\
\   &20 = line from point 0 to point 2
\   &03 = line from point 3 to point 0
\   &35 = line from point 5 to point 3
\   &58 = line from point 8 to point 5
\   &86 = line from point 6 to point 8
\
\ which looks like this on the grid:
\
\   +-------+
\   |   .   .
\   +-------+
\   .   .   |
\   +-------+
\   .   .   .
\
\ The definition in LTDEF for "," is:
\
\   &63, &34, &47, &76, &97
\
\ This translates to the following:
\
\   &63 = line from point 3 to point 6
\   &34 = line from point 4 to point 3
\   &47 = line from point 7 to point 4
\   &76 = line from point 6 to point 7
\   &97 = line from point 7 to point 9
\
\ which looks like this on the grid:
\
\   .   .   .
\   .   .   .
\   +---+   .
\   |   |   .
\   +---/   .
