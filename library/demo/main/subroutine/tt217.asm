\    Summary: Scan the keyboard until a key is pressed
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Scan the keyboard until a key is pressed, and return the key's ASCII code.
\ If, on entry, a key is already being held down, then wait until that key is
\ released first (so this routine detects the first key down event following
\ the subroutine call).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   The ASCII code of the key that was pressed
\
\   A                   Contains the same as X
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   out                 Contains an RTS
