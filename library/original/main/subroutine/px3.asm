\
\       Name: PX3
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Plot a single pixel at (X, Y) within a character block
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called from PIXEL to set 1 pixel within a character block for
\ a distant point (i.e. where the distance ZZ >= &90). See the PIXEL routine for
\ details, as this routine is effectively part of PIXEL.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The x-coordinate of the pixel within the character block
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the pixel within the character block
\
\   SC(1 0)             The screen address of the character block
\
\   T1                  The value of Y to restore on exit, so Y is preserved by
\                       the call to PIXEL
